Welcome!
My name is Juan Padron (full name: Juan Vicente Padron Parraga), and I work as an assistant professor at the Mechatronics Laboratory @ Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), Japan.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2022 from NUT at the Motion Control Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Kiyoshi Ohishi.

My Ph.D. work focused on the development of an unified control-based, model-less compensation algorithm for nonlinear friction and backlash in geared servomotors.
