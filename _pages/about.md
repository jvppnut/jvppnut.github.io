Welcome!
My name is Juan Padron (*full name: Juan Vicente Padron Parraga*), and I work as an assistant professor at the [Mechatronics Laboratory](https://whs.nagaokaut.ac.jp/elemech/index.html) @ Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), Japan.


Brief profile
======

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2022 from NUT at the Motion Control Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Kiyoshi Ohishi.
My Ph.D. work focused on the development of an unified control-based, model-less compensation algorithm for nonlinear friction and backlash in geared servomotors using disturbance observers.

Research interests
--------
- Force control and human-robot interaction.
- Disturbance observer-based control.
- Compensation of nonlinear phenomena through control-based solutions.

Education
--------
- B.E. Electronics Engineering - Universidad Simon Bolivar, Venezuela (2016)
- M.E. Electrical Engineering - Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan (2019)
- Ph.D. Electrical Engineering - Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan (2022); Thesis title: [Switched-Dimension Disturbance Observers and Dimensional Analogy for Motion Control Systems with Backlash and Nonlinear Friction](https://nagaokaut.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=1004&file_id=20&file_no=3)
